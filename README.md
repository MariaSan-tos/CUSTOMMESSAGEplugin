  # CUSTOM MESSAGE Minecraft plugin 
This plugins adds a different CUSTOM message for new players and makes a new item with a new recipe! To test it,
download the "teste-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" file on the Tag "Pre-Release" and put it on the "plugins" folder on your server!

It works on 1.20.2!

Do not expect much, I just wanted to try making a Plugin and it worked, but I am still DEVELOPING!


<h2>HOW TO CHANGE</h2>

- To change the message, go to teste.java and custumize in the Event Handler!
